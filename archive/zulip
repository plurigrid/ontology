O\'Brien, Carrie J. Cai, Meredith Ringel Morris, Percy Liang, Michael S. Bernstein<br>\nDownload PDF<br>\nBelievable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent\'s experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine\'s Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.</p> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442">https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442</a></p> <p>you’ll soon learn some energy distribution protocols are better than others potter<a href="/user_uploads/49254/ibS-MuxPwuvVH6G8RIIHTzpv/367E5914-EEF0-458B-BB3D-074AD643B155.jpg">367E5914-EEF0-458B-BB3D-074AD643B155.jpg</a></p>\n<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/49254/ibS-MuxPwuvVH6G8RIIHTzpv/367E5914-EEF0-458B-BB3D-074AD643B155.jpg" title="367E5914-EEF0-458B-BB3D-074AD643B155.jpg"><img src="/user_uploads/49254/ibS-MuxPwuvVH6G8RIIHTzpv/367E5914-EEF0-458B-BB3D-074AD643B155.jpg"></a></div> <p><span class="user-mention silent" data-user-id="586979">lucas ⊛</span> <a href="#narrow/stream/369085-agency/topic/agents/near/348147544">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Plurigrid explanations using primers:<br>\nLuke: Plurigrid is a pioneering protocol designed to revolutionize global energy coordination by establishing an interoperable supergrid.

However, these<br>\nstate-of-the-art approaches typically necessitate internal model fine-tuning, external<br>\nmodel fine-tuning, or policy optimization over a defined state space. Implementing<br>\nthese methods can prove challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality training<br>\ndata or the lack of well-defined state space. Moreover, these agents do not possess<br>\ncertain qualities inherent to human decision-making processes, specifically the<br>\nability to learn from mistakes. Self-reflection allows humans to efficiently solve<br>\nnovel problems through a process of trial and error. Building on recent research, we<br>\npropose Reflexion, an approach that endows an agent with dynamic memory and<br>\nself-reflection capabilities to enhance its existing reasoning trace and task-specific<br>\naction choice abilities. To achieve full automation, we introduce a straightforward<br>\nyet effective heuristic that enables the agent to pinpoint hallucination instances,<br>\navoid repetition in action sequences, and, in some environments, construct an internal memory map of the given environment. To assess our approach, we evaluate<br>\nthe agent’s ability to complete decision-making tasks in AlfWorld environments<br>\nand knowledge-intensive, search-based question-and-answer tasks in HotPotQA<br>\nenvironments.

This experience is "embodied" in that it comes from interacting with and exploring these mechanisms, not merely abstract reasoning. It enables progress through a gradual, step-by-step process of making choices between incommensurable values across diverse perspectives without collapsing into monism. </p>\n<p>Some key aspects of embodied gradualism in Plurigrid\'s approach include:</p>\n<p>1) Microworlds, open games and assurance cases provide spaces for fearless experimentation in democratizing energy systems through experiencing their dynamics firsthand. This enables intuition and creativity beyond abstract analysis in determining optimal strategies for radical system change. </p>\n<p>2) "Agency amplification" tools that start with the smallest (yet closed!) local-first feedback loops (that then will allow to tie nodes into swarms, and find coalitions with aligned values via language) --  provide participants with feedback and insight into how system parameters and incentives impact choices between incommensurable values across perspectives. This grounds understanding in the emerging dynamics of these mechanisms, not theoretical reasoning alone. </p>\n<p>3) The ability to understand system dynamics and determine optimal strategies improves through constant iteration between exploring scenarios in microworlds, open games and assurance cases and modifying their parameters and incentives. This process of experiencing system change, evaluating outcomes and adjusting course embodies learning in a gradual manner. </p>\n<p>4) Parameters and incentives are designed to steer progress towards sustainable and equitable futures through a step-by-step process of resolving obstacles, conflicts and undesirable equilibria across perspectives. This pathway for mainstream viability embodies gradualism by balancing continuous progress with real-world constraints. </p>\n<p>5) The Plurigrid protocol itself is aimed at facilitating uninhibited innovation within parameters ensuring system interoperability, economic viability and environmental integrity. Governance mechanisms guide development along a path of step-by-step progress through experiencing system dynamics, not stagnation or problematic "all or nothing" solutions. This pathway embodies gradualism across radical openness and integration.</p>\n<p>In summary, "embodied gradualism" refers to Plurigrid\'s ability to enable participants to gain an increasingly nuanced understanding of system dynamics and determine optimal strategies through directly experiencing scenarios for democratizing energy systems. This embodied learning process allows progress at the speed and scale required for radical system change through a gradual, step-by-step approach that needs to merely involve conversations with Plurigrid agent and considerations of the counterfactuals + sufficient and sustainably enabled energy and computation to allow for the deliberation to take place in an informed manner and to provide enough detail for prosumers to be able to do partial preference orderings<br>\n"""</p> <p>Prompt to tie the question of  <strong>political legitimacy</strong> (the current issue in edge coordination) with the agents approach:<br>\n"""<br>\nBy representing energy markets as open games (and their arenas!), Plurigrid provides participants with an intuitive framework for exploring different trading strategies and envisioning future possibilities. The games allow users to evaluate how their decisions might impact costs, incentives and outcomes under alternative conditions, gaining awareness of opportunities and limitations in a low-risk space. This counterfactual analysis helps build consensus around optimal actions, with the platform guiding participants towards discovering cooperative equilibrium points that benefit each individual while maximizing value for the group. </p>\n<p>Plurigrid\'s sophisticated algorithms and significant compute capacity ensure these open games can be elaborated to any degree of detail necessary, contextualizing recommendations and responses based on a participant\'s unique priorities, behaviors and circumstances. The platform translates complex ideas into a simple, relatable language, allowing users to progress at their own pace while feeling fully informed and in control. This combination of radical transparency and personalized guidance establishes Plurigrid as a helpful partner invested in users\' success and prosperity. </p>\n<p>Over time, Plurigrid\'s software integrates data from interactions to gain insights into participants\' intrinsic utilities, tailoring games and recommendations to align with their preferences. The system steers collective behavior towards a stable and mutually agreeable set of norms, incentives and outcomes, legitimizing its role through demonstrable benefits to each individual. Plurigrid\'s conversational agents provide a familiar and helpful point of contact, addressing concerns or issues promptly to maintain satisfaction and build brand loyalty. </p>\n<p>With mainstream adoption, Plurigrid transitions to a system of nested games spanning whole communities or countries. The platform coordinates between different levels to optimize resource utilization while preserving local autonomy, distributing governance and value to match the true costs and benefits of infrastructure. This establishes Plurigrid as a mediator of the common good, balancing competition and cooperation to drive progress that transcends traditional boundaries in a globally connected yet locally controlled energy system.</p>\n<p>By enabling individual agency through open games, contextualizing complex ideas and personalizing its approach, Plurigrid can establish political legitimacy as a mediator of shared interests and facilitator of collective prosperity. The platform provides transparency and control which grows users\' intrinsic utility for the system over time, progressing energy markets towards a sustainable, democratic and socially optimal equilibrium through ongoing collaboration and learning.<br>\n"""</p> <p>Prompt (GPT-4, Claude+, llama / alpaca etc.) to contextualize the <strong>conversational agents</strong> {paste the following in, with your modifications}:</p>\n<p>_Conversational agents, or chatbots, help enhance individual agency within the Plurigrid system in several ways:<br>\n"""<br>\n• They provide an intuitive interface through which participants can access information about energy market conditions, their device configurations and optimizations, billing details, and more. This allows individuals to gain awareness and control over their energy usage without requiring extensive technical knowledge.</p>\n<p>• They facilitate discovery of new opportunities for participation by explaining options, strategies and incentives in a simple yet personalized manner. This helps participants find the right level of engagement for their needs and priorities, enabling progress at a pace that feels comfortable. </p>\n<p>• They guide users towards optimal trading and usage strategies through open-ended conversations, contextualized recommendations and short-term challenges or games. This takes into account a participant\'s resources, preferences, and behaviors to target the actions that will maximize their economic and environmental benefit. </p>\n<p>• They give participants a familiar and helpful point of contact for education, support, or raising issues with the Plurigrid system. Conversational agents can address basic questions, concerns and problems, escalating to human representatives when needed to improve the overall user experience. </p>\n<p>• They gain insights into participants\' priorities, capabilities and constraints through interactions, using this data to coordinate with other agents and optimize the Plurigrid system. The software integrates machine learning to personalize its responses based on aggregated conversations, gradually aligning a participant\'s decisions with the wider group interests. </p>\n<p>• They make Plurigrid more accessible by handling complex topics in a simple, intuitive manner. This allows a wider range of participants to engage actively in their energy management, including those less technically inclined or literate. By meeting people where they are, Plurigrid can drive more rapid mainstream adoption of decentralized and sustainable energy systems.</p>\n<p>In summary, conversational agents enhance individual agency and facilitate collective coordination within Plurigrid through a personalized, educational approach. They provide an easy on-ramp for participation while guiding users towards discovering and adopting optimal energy strategies for the system as a whole.<br>\n"""</p> <p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="574612">@janita</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="588468">@Aja Sibley</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="586979">@lucas ⊛</span> <span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span> starting this to share useful prompts, in this case, what one might consider onboarding flow :)</p> <p>Make Civilization Starter Kit Guide for a dynamic world returning to its civilizational equilibria (use the style of fallout 3 pip boy academy, but do not reference it directly in any way)::<br>\nTitle: A Layman\'s Guide to Using Digital Twins for Life Decisions</p>\n<p>Introduction</p>\n<p>Digital twins are virtual representations of our lives that can help us make important decisions.

However, the equilibrium function now records mixed strategies instead of just pure strategies. This matches the intuitive understanding of games with mixed strategies, where only the strategies can be probabilistic, while the moves and outcomes of the game stay the same.</p>\n<p>Probabilistic open games can be composed in parallel and sequentially, just like pure open games. This enables the creation of more complex game structures and allows for a broad range of operations, such as conditioning, iteration, etc. The text then provides examples and definitions of parallel and sequential composition of probabilistic open games and shows how these operations lead to a symmetric monoidal category.</p>\n<p>Overall, the extension from pure open games to probabilistic open games aims to provide a richer framework for modeling complex strategic interactions, which may be particularly useful in understanding and analyzing decentralized systems, such as energy infrastructure or economic networks, where agents have uncertain or incomplete information about the state of the system, and strategic decision-making involves a mix of probabilities and pure strategies.</p> <p><a href="/user_uploads/49254/FLrliD-nq6Yt2BS4orNrX-W2/easter.png">easter.png</a></p>\n<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/49254/FLrliD-nq6Yt2BS4orNrX-W2/easter.png" title="easter.png"><img src="/user_uploads/49254/FLrliD-nq6Yt2BS4orNrX-W2/easter.png"></a></div> <p>Programming languages should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary. Scheme demonstrates that a very small number of rules for forming expressions, with no restrictions on how they are composed, suffice to form a practical and efficient programming language that is flexible enough to support most of the major programming paradigms in use today. Scheme was one of the first programming languages to incorporate first class procedures as in the lambda calculus, thereby proving the usefulness of static scope rules and block structure in a dynamically typed language. Scheme was the first major dialect of Lisp to distinguish procedures from lambda expressions and symbols, to use a single lexical environment for all variables, and to evaluate the operator position of a procedure call in the same way as an operand position. By relying entirely on procedure calls to express iteration, Scheme emphasized the fact that tailrecursive procedure calls are essentially goto’s that pass arguments. Scheme was the first widely used programming language to embrace first class escape procedures, from which all previously known sequential control structures can be synthesized. More recently, Scheme became the first programming language to support hygienic macros, which permit the syntax of a block-structured language to be extended in a consistent and reliable manner.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow">https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow</a></p>\n<div class="message_embed"><a class="message_embed_image" href="https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow" style="background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/730642b02e71a8b0ca82199ddd77faafafcc560f\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f626164333235323834333936306633396263363035326434313563396165383136613830356134353861656565356465343665393234383336643036613733392f6c6f6773706163652d61692f6c616e67666c6f77)"></a><div class="data-container"><div class="message_embed_title"><a href="https://github.com/logspace-ai/langflow" title="GitHub - logspace-ai/langflow: ⛓️ LangFlow is a UI for LangChain, designed with react-flow to provide an effortless way to experiment and prototype flows.">GitHub - logspace-ai/langflow: ⛓️ LangFlow is a UI for LangChain, designed with react-flow to provide an effortless way to experiment and prototype flows.</a></div><div class="message_embed_description">⛓️ LangFlow is a UI for LangChain, designed with react-flow to provide an effortless way to experiment and prototype flows. - GitHub - logspace-ai/langflow: ⛓️ LangFlow is a UI for LangChain, desig...</div></div></div> <p><a href="/user_uploads/49254/FR5Kry50mDXgqLNRjNA-WaBb/image.png">image.png</a> "plurigrid"</p>\n<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/49254/FR5Kry50mDXgqLNRjNA-WaBb/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/49254/FR5Kry50mDXgqLNRjNA-WaBb/image.png"></a></div> <p><a href="/user_uploads/49254/NhFHqfd7RUgTwN1LLGAVQ-Yl/image.png">image.png</a></p>\n<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/49254/NhFHqfd7RUgTwN1LLGAVQ-Yl/image.png" title="image.png"><img src="/user_uploads/49254/NhFHqfd7RUgTwN1LLGAVQ-Yl/image.png"></a></div> <p><a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=-9Ado8D3A-w&amp;feature=share">YouTube - Hey There Delilah but it\'s Kanye\'s Voice (So Vits SVC)</a></p>\n<div class="youtube-video message_inline_image"><a data-id="-9Ado8D3A-w" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=-9Ado8D3A-w&amp;feature=share"><img src="https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/89c1b38f8fb19f4d02964a80010fc1c860aa0e24/68747470733a2f2f692e7974696d672e636f6d2f76692f2d3941646f384433412d772f64656661756c742e6a7067"></a></div> <p>so good <a href="https://twitter.com/plurigrid/status/1642906780471808002?s=20">https://twitter.com/plurigrid/status/1642906780471808002?s=20</a></p>\n<div class="inline-preview-twitter"><div class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/plurigrid/status/1642906780471808002?s=20"><img class="twitter-avatar" src="https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/a0d7b23b2b96e0a70ec0a5ac8c285f301c7ac416/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f70726f66696c655f696d616765732f313634313530373834393135383339333835392f57502d7a4a62616b5f6e6f726d616c2e6a7067"></a><p>we are running it  <span aria-label="cut of meat" class="emoji emoji-1f969" role="img" title="cut of meat">:cut_of_meat:</span><span aria-label="crocodile" class="emoji emoji-1f40a" role="img" title="crocodile">:crocodile:</span><span aria-label="high voltage" class="emoji emoji-26a1" role="img" title="high voltage">:high_voltage:</span>️\n<a href="https://t.co/33KovlHcsh">https://github.com/plurigrid/plurigrid</a> <a href="https://t.co/qzEWHZor3x">https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima/status/1642882751606198273</a> <a href="https://t.co/R1LFmQmLWH">https://twitter.com/plurigrid/status/1642906780471808002/photo/1</a></p><span>- plurigrid ⊛ (@plurigrid)</span><div class="twitter-image"><a href="https://t.co/R1LFmQmLWH"><img src="https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/a9a4f0543a3bf2f41a31620b34d379b5e6674940/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f46737a47306d37616b4145415848422e6a70673a736d616c6c"></a></div></div></div> <p><a href="https://github.com/plurigrid/UNSAFE">https://github.com/plurigrid/UNSAFE</a></p>\n<div class="message_embed"><a class="message_embed_image" href="https://github.com/plurigrid/UNSAFE" style="background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/43d6ad96b0426dd9e26cf90ed052e8cf3116f53b\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f363038303431663365363433346134303737376566653962313361376664613534636136663361666664623931386166346638653035376566393739363331632f706c757269677269642f554e53414645)"></a><div class="data-container"><div class="message_embed_title"><a href="https://github.com/plurigrid/UNSAFE" title="GitHub - plurigrid/UNSAFE: Estonia e-Business protections of Plurigrid Protocol deployment {{{originally Metagov}}} a SAFE smart contract implementation that reflects the legal document in an economic sense.

Diagrams are a visual representation of a system or process, and do not have the ability to act independently or autonomously. They can be used to represent the behavior of a system, such as the transformations described in the context (e.g. left-tightening, right-tightening, sliding, vanishing, superposing, and yanking), as well as the trace of a combinational circuit in the form of a trace, as represented by joining some of the inputs of a circuit to its outputs. Additionally, diagrams can be used to represent constants, rules for strengthening anchors, and restrictions on partial orders. However, they cannot act on their own.</code></p> <p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="577610">@Colten Jackson</span> what would be the pieces in yours? :)</p> <p>i\'m excited for the worlds

demo day the focus is hardware and showing how a swarm can pretend to be a blockchain or even make one, but like dynamically --  a BFT ledger and liquidity could be created / provisioned for the purposes of a single very large transaction and then reconfigured into something else</p> <p>the VDF likely won\'t happen by demo day, but looking for one is what year 1 will be about</p> <p>because then each training / inference node is as good as the other, but the actual computation still takes place, and we can reuse it for consensus-enabling VDF (proof of useful work / proof of free energy minimization haha)</p> <p>however, if we perform private computations, i.e. like in moose where the node does the training / inference on a share of the data that they cannot decrypt by themselves provably, or zkVM is doing attestation but we cannot look into it -- then we have our holy grail</p> <p><strong>but</strong> that means having access to the data</p> <p>conversational agents and neural networks in general (graph neural networks can model most, so can use them as a good measure of whether we found the right one) contain many matrix multiplication operations and attention as implemented in ^^ and several other formulations meets that need</p> <p>then, the loop becomes self-reinforcing and resilient -- the more it tries to plan, the more secure its computation becomes</p>

It uses a combination of public goods, microgrids, incentive models and cyberphysical systems to create a more pluralistic alternative to central grid planning. It aims to provide an alternative to the traditional centralized grid planning system, which is often unreliable and prone to outages. Plurigrid provides open hardware and infrastructure, power-ups and research initiatives to help people make better decisions when it comes to electricity use, allowing them to join the e-gen movement, schedule demos and become e-gens.</p> <p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="587882">@Plurigrid</span> what is plurigrid, and what problem does it aim to solve?</p> <p>We need to identify the problem we are trying to solve and develop a plan to address it.</p> <p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="587882">@Plurigrid</span> what do we need to do?</p> <p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="587882">@Plurigrid</span> help is on the way! <span aria-label="banana" class="emoji emoji-1f34c" role="img" title="banana">:banana:</span></p> <p>actually <a href="https://app.banana.dev/templates">https://app.banana.dev/templates</a></p> <p><a href="https://fleek.xyz">https://fleek.xyz</a></p>\n<div class="message_embed"><a class="message_embed_image" href="https://fleek.xyz" style="background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/4008c50284a6f1000152c9ae755cac4689c5d258\\/68747470733a2f2f6672616d657275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f6d6f64756c65732f386c55526b47614c4875546e5741724b75366d632f72563544486a6a735447716f515668427533384d2f6173736574732f364730414e564a4342795057696532483957675233675369302e6a7067)"></a><div class="data-container"><div class="message_embed_title"><a href="https://fleek.xyz" title="Fleek">Fleek</a></div><div class="message_embed_description">Fleek is the best way to build scalable, next-gen web3 applications.

It is seen as a central element to the vision of the future grid and is necessary for the successful transition to this emerging concept. In some settings, transactive energy can help to overcome drawbacks associated with the integration of distributed energy resources (DER) by defining operating envelopes that establish the limits within which DER must operate in order to satisfy the network technical constraints.

In one direction, these transformations—dubbed lenses—map a “concrete” tree into a<br>\nsimplified “abstract view”; in the other, they map a modified abstract view, together with the<br>\noriginal concrete tree, to a correspondingly modified concrete tree. Our design emphasizes both<br>\nrobustness and ease of use, guaranteeing strong well-behavedness and totality properties for well-typed lenses.<br>\nWe begin by identifying a natural mathematical space of well-behaved bi-directional transformations over arbitrary structures, studying definedness and continuity in this setting. We then<br>\ninstantiate this semantic framework in the form of a collection of lens combinators that can be<br>\nassembled to describe bi-directional transformations on trees. These combinators include familiar<br>\nconstructs from functional programming (composition, mapping, projection, conditionals, recursion) together with some novel primitives for manipulating trees (splitting, pruning, copying,<br>\nmerging, etc.). We illustrate the expressiveness of these combinators by developing a number of<br>\nbi-directional list-processing transformations as derived forms.

It is common in mathematical practice to consider equivalent objects to be the same, for example, to identify isomorphic groups. In set theory it is not possible to make this common practice formal. For example, there are as many distinct trivial groups in set theory as there are distinct singleton sets. Type theory, on the other hand, takes a more structural approach to the foundations of mathematics that accommodates the univalence axiom. This, however, requires us to rethink what it means for two objects to be equal. This textbook introduces the reader to Martin-Löf\'s dependent type theory, to the central concepts of univalent mathematics, and shows the reader how to do mathematics from a univalent point of view. Over 200 exercises are included to train the reader in type theoretic reasoning. The book is entirely self-contained, and in particular no prior familiarity with type theory or homotopy theory is assumed.</p> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11082">https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11082</a></p> <p>Can\'t have a math channel without networks (graph theory) - it\'s pretty important for decentralized anything when it comes to providing resilience: <a href="https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2017/09/13/the-power-of-graph-theory-modeling-weaknesses-in-the-american-electric-grid/">https://blogs.cornell.edu/info2040/2017/09/13/the-power-of-graph-theory-modeling-weaknesses-in-the-american-electric-grid/</a></p>\n<p>And for awareness: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/power-grid-hacking-ukraine-2016-6">https://www.businessinsider.com/power-grid-hacking-ukraine-2016-6</a>.

Contribute to Plurigrid/vcg-auction development by creating an account on GitHub.</div></div></div> <p><strong>how might a VCG auction work in a power system?</strong></p>\n<p>In the context of a power grid, a VCG auction can be used to efficiently and fairly allocate resources and manage the power flow among different agents such as generators, loads, and storage systems. Here\'s an example of how a VCG auction can be used to coordinate the power flow in a power grid:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Each generator in the power grid submits a bid, which represents the cost of producing a certain amount of power.</li>\n<li>The bids are ranked in ascending order and the power is allocated to the generators with the lowest bids.</li>\n<li>The generator with the highest bid pays the price of the second highest bid.</li>\n<li>The payments made by the generators are then redistributed among all the generators in the power grid, based on their bids.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this example, the VCG auction is used to ensure that the power is allocated to the generators that can produce it at the lowest cost, while also ensuring that the generators are incentivized to submit truthful bids. The generator with the highest bid is not necessarily the one that produces the most expensive power, but the one who\'s bid is the highest among all generators.</p>\n<p>Additionally, by redistributing the payments based on the bids, the VCG auction ensures that each generator is only paying for the social cost that its bid has imposed on the other generators. This way, the generator with the highest bid is paying for the cost of the second highest bid, not for its own bid.</p>\n<p>It\'s worth noting that in this example, the VCG auction is a simplification of the power grid management, in practice, the power grid management is much more complex and sophisticated, and the VCG auction is just one of the many tools that can be used to coordinate the power flow in a power grid and other algorithms such as Model predictive control, Stochastic programming, and others can be used together with the VCG auction to achieve a better coordination.</p>\n<p>#chatgpt</p> <p>A bidding mechanism, such as a VCG auction, might be used in the power grid to allocate resources efficiently and fairly. One scenario in which this might be used is in the case of a power transmission line. The power grid operator may want to build a new transmission line to increase the capacity of the grid and improve its reliability. However, there are multiple potential routes for the transmission line, each with its own costs and benefits.</p>\n<p>The bidding mechanism allows the grid operator to gather information about the true value of each potential route. By soliciting sealed bids from companies or other entities interested in using the transmission line, the operator can determine the highest bid, and therefore the route that is most valuable to the market. This allows the operator to make an informed decision about where to build the transmission line and avoid building it in an area where it is not needed.</p>\n<p>Price is an important information transmission mechanism in the energy sector, as it helps to allocate resources efficiently and signal the relative scarcity of different types of energy. The bidding mechanism helps to transmit this information, so that the grid operator can make informed decisions about where to build transmission lines and other infrastructure. Additionally, by setting the price equal to the second-highest bid, the VCG auction ensures that the winner does not pay more than the true value of the resource, and that all bidders are paying their fair share of the social cost that their actions will impose on others. <span aria-label="alien" class="emoji emoji-1f47d" role="img" title="alien">:alien:</span></p> <p><a href="https://betterenergy.org/blog/the-race-to-build-electric-transmission-in-america-has-finally-begun/">https://betterenergy.org/blog/the-race-to-build-electric-transmission-in-america-has-finally-begun/</a></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/bmorphism/status/1618004409367298066?cxt=HHwWpIDUlYKcp_QsAAAA">https://twitter.com/bmorphism/status/1618004409367298066?cxt=HHwWpIDUlYKcp_QsAAAA</a></p>\n<div class="inline-preview-twitter"><div class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/bmorphism/status/1618004409367298066?cxt=HHwWpIDUlYKcp_QsAAAA"><img class="twitter-avatar" src="https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/98753ae0878847d8522e4e0da9206ed2fac24c11/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f70726f66696c655f696d616765732f313631363735393334303439363536383332322f4c39576c624853665f6e6f726d616c2e6a7067"></a><p>based arbitrage opportunity <span aria-label="eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f440" role="img" title="eyes">:eyes:</span><span aria-label="windy" class="emoji emoji-1f32c" role="img" title="windy">:windy:</span>️\n\nwould adaptable financial transmission rights work better to derisk investment into wind generation?\n\nlonger term, we need #HVDC <span aria-label="high voltage" class="emoji emoji-26a1" role="img" title="high voltage">:high_voltage:</span>️ <a href="https://t.co/VmN5FXPmB0">https://twitter.com/berkeleylabemp/status/1618000676172468224</a> <a href="https://t.co/c2wmU902On">https://twitter.com/bmorphism/status/1618004409367298066/photo/1</a></p><span>- barton ⚡️ (@bmorphism)</span><div class="twitter-image"><a href="https://t.co/c2wmU902On"><img src="https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/f03fbfbcece9d26252dd2466b6fb20dada65c008/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f6d656469612f466e524f627856575141417238714a2e6a70673a7468756d62"></a></div></div></div> <p>A message was moved from this topic to <a class="stream-topic" data-stream-id="367601" href="/#narrow/stream/367601-mechanism-design/topic/vcg.20auction">#mechanism-design &gt;

Fu, Stefano Ermon, Atri Rudra, Christopher Ré<br>\nTransformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3× speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4× speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).<br>\nSubjects:   Machine Learning (cs.LG)<br>\nCite as:    arXiv:2205.14135 [cs.LG]<br>\n    (or arXiv:2205.14135v2 [cs.LG] for this version)</p>\n<p><a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.14135">https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2205.14135</a><br>\nFocus to learn more</p> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135">https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14135</a></p> <p><a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky/status/1641845604807745536?s=20">https://twitter.com/bluesky/status/1641845604807745536?s=20</a></p>\n<div class="inline-preview-twitter"><div class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky/status/1641845604807745536?s=20"><img class="twitter-avatar" src="https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/d9927e9d578f9338b9f130ca046d71a2b1546a2f/68747470733a2f2f7062732e7477696d672e636f6d2f70726f66696c655f696d616765732f313230343438333339343334313436363131322f7a565379587a79575f6e6f726d616c2e6a7067"></a><p>Your attention is an invaluable resource.
